# Project Directory Structure Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of the main directories and their purposes in **Project Eagle Eye**. Organizing these directories properly is crucial for maintaining the clarity, scalability, and effectiveness of the project as it grows.

---

## 1. `docs/` - Documentation

This folder contains all documentation files for the project, providing essential information for users and contributors:
- **`README.md`**: The primary introduction to the project, covering the project’s purpose, goals, usage instructions, and setup requirements.
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**: Outlines expected behaviors for all contributors, creating a welcoming, respectful environment.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Guides new contributors on how to get involved with the project, including how to set up the development environment, submit changes, and meet coding standards.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**: Details the project's structure, explaining how different components interact and are organized.

---

## 2. `src/` - Source Code

This folder holds the core code for the project. It is organized to ensure modularity, making it easy to understand and update:
- **`main.py`**: The main file for running the project, often serving as the entry point.
- **`module1/` and `module2/`**: Subdirectories for different code modules, organizing code by functionality.
  - **`__init__.py`**: This file designates the folder as a Python package, allowing for easy imports.
  - **`feature1.py` and `feature2.py`**: Files within each module, each focusing on a specific functionality or feature.

This structured approach simplifies testing, debugging, and extending the project.

---

## 3. `tests/` - Testing

The `tests/` directory is essential for verifying code functionality and ensuring stability:
- **`test_module1.py` and `test_module2.py`**: Each module in the `src/` folder has a corresponding test file here to check its functionalities.
- Tests help identify and prevent issues as new features are added or changes are made, using tools like `pytest` or `unittest` for automation.

---

## 4. `data/` - Data

This directory stores any data files used in the project:
- **`raw/`**: Holds raw, unprocessed data.
- **`processed/`**: Contains data that has been cleaned or transformed and is ready for use in analysis.

This separation makes it easy to track data throughout its processing stages and ensures raw data is preserved.

---

## 5. `scripts/` - Helper Scripts

The `scripts/` directory includes auxiliary scripts to assist in running and managing the project:
- **`setup.py`**: Handles the setup process, which may involve installing dependencies or configuring settings.
- **`preprocess_data.py`**: Prepares data by cleaning, transforming, or otherwise processing it before analysis or model training.

Storing these scripts separately keeps the main codebase clean and organized.

---

## 6. `assets/` - Visual Assets

This directory stores images, diagrams, and other visual resources:
- **`diagrams/`**: Architectural diagrams, data flow charts, and other visual representations of the project structure.
- **`screenshots/`**: Screenshots or example outputs to support documentation or illustrate user interfaces.

Visual assets help clarify complex information for new users and contributors.

---

## 7. `examples/` - Usage Examples

The `examples/` folder contains usage examples to guide users on how to utilize the project’s features:
- **`example_usage.py`**: Demonstrates key functionalities, serving as a quick-start reference.

Providing examples helps users understand the project quickly and start using it effectively.

---

## 8. `config/` - Configuration Files

The `config/` folder houses configuration settings, allowing easy adjustments and deployment:
- **`config.yaml`**: Stores key-value pairs for settings like API keys, database credentials, and other essential configurations.

This organization simplifies project deployment and facilitates environment-specific settings management.

---

## 9. `LICENSE` - Licensing Information

The `LICENSE` file outlines the legal terms and conditions under which the project can be used, including permissions, restrictions, and attributions required when using or modifying the code.

---

Each directory has a specific role in maintaining project organization, usability, and scalability, contributing to the project’s long-term success.
